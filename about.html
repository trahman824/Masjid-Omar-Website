               <p>Masjid:- “Omar ben Abdel-Aziz”, The Islamic Foundation, Inc. started with Taraweeh prayer in the basement of the home of Brother Mohammad Jaffar in 1989 which lead to the five daily prayers and Islamic classes in the basement of Brother Mohammad Khaleel.  In 1990 we then moved to Brother Mashmood Ally’s newly purchased home in Queens Village.  The basement was donated for the month of Ramadan. After that the Islamic Foundation was granted permission from the City of New York to use an Elementary school for the of Saturday classes for the children, this provision was very costly. we also use to hire the YMCA building to conduct Masressa classes, Eid Prayers and other related program scheduled for the year.
                  The present building was bought on September 30th, 1992 and was renovated to accommodate the prayer area on second floor and a Madressa, Kitchen, washroom, and other facilities on the first floor. The site now owns an adjacent lot for further expansion. Presently it is beening used as a parking lot for cars and the lot has been paid for in full. The 103 precinct and the Department of Traffic has allowed three hours of free parking on 161& 162 streets from Hillside to Jamaica Avenue on Fridays and on special occasions.
                  This building can accommodate approximately 421 people. It is a brick and cement block, two story building, situate between Hillside and 89th Ave. and easily accessible to subway (F & E train to Parsons Blvd.) and buses.
